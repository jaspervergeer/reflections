How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file 
help you see the bug that was introduced?

You can see exactly where in the code you have changed things, 
so you know where to look for the bug or typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can use older versions as templates for similar programs. 
And you can relflect on the way you solved different problems and 
how you came up with solutions. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: You van decide when to save so you can do so at logical intervals
when you finished a feature in your program.

cons: You can forget to save for a while.
