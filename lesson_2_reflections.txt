What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden git folder. You need to do this so git can 
store meta data to track the changes in your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that are going to 
be included in our commit. You can choose which files you
want to commit.
